## Objective

I wanted to create a personal site to contain my projects along with the steps I took to create them, hence the motivation for this site. Specifically, I wanted
to be able to:

- easily add content
- keep the site simple
- look somewhat nice

I'm not very good in web development and my js skills are ... nonexistent. That led me to look at other personal sites for inspiration.

## Inspiration and credits

I have to give a lot of credit to Supercip971 on github. I essentially used his 
(?) styling and idea of using Markdown to create this simple website.

## Dynamic html generation

## Markdown to html conversion

## Testing with a build directory

## Deployment

## Conclusion
