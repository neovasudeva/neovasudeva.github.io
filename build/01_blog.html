    <h1>
        creating a simple personal site
    </h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>I wanted to create a personal site to contain my projects along with the steps I took to create them, hence the motivation for this site. Specifically, I wanted
to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>easily add content</li>
<li>keep the site simple</li>
<li>look somewhat nice</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not very good in web development and my js skills are ... nonexistent. That led me to look at other personal sites for inspiration.</p>
<h2>Inspiration and credits</h2>
<p>I have to give a lot of credit to Supercip971 on github. I essentially used his 
(?) styling and idea of using Markdown to create this simple website.</p>
<h2>Dynamic html generation</h2>
<p>coming soon ...</p>
<h2>Markdown to html conversion</h2>
<p>coming soon ...</p>
<h2>Testing with a build directory</h2>
<p>coming soon ...</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>coming soon ...</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>coming soon ...</p>
